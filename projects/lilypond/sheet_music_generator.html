      <h1 class="mt-5">counterpoint sheet music generator</h1>
      <p class="lead">using c++ and lilypond</p>
      <p>What is counterpoint and why does it make a good candidate for using code to generate music?</p>
      <p>Counterpoint is a specific style of music, where one melody is generated based on the note that came before,
        using specific rules. This means that if you can write a melody, the program can write a counterpoint to go
        along with it. </p>

      <p>These images are from Burstein, L. Poundie., and Joseph Nathan. Straus. <em>Concise Introduction to Tonal
          Harmony.</em>
        W.W. Norton, 2016. The top image demonstrates a counterpoint melody, and the numbers represent the intervals
        between the notes. The bottom image shows some of the rules for what counterpoint melodies cannot do.

      <p>This program was written in C++, and was designed to export text that fit the .ly file format. Here is the
        class hierarchy diagram.</p>

      <p>The goal for this project is to build a program that generates correct two-voice counterpoint. <br>
        This project has four distinct parts: a note class, a class/function that combines all the rules, classes of
        rules, and a class/function that outputs a .ly file.

        <li>Assumptions
          <ul>
            <li>The users are good actors</li>
            <li>The user will not want to write counterpoint in a minor key</li>
            <li>The user cannot choose what specific notes they want</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: Caleb N. and I worked on this project together.<br>
        The code still runs, though there are now build errors. I ran it, and this is what the program looked like:</p>
      <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../../images/musicgenerator/image3.png" alt="Green computer text">
      <p>It created a file, which, once I found it, imports into LilyPond correctly and plays. You can copy the
        outputted text and put it into hacklily.org (also linked below) to see the sheet music. I generated the first
        two phrases in style 0, then in style 1, then style 2, then finally style 0 again.
        <br>Here is the first bit of the output:
      </p>
      <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../../images/musicgenerator/image4.png" alt="Sheet music">
      <p>I am very impressed that it still runs. It looks like there are some notes for which the logic may be wrong,
        given the large jumps up and down occasionally, and when I listened to it I heard at least one major second,
        which I don't think should be there (the last note in measure five). Still, I haven't looked at this code in
        three years, and I'm kinda impressed with my past self. What a cool project xD <br>
        I uploaded all the project files to <a href="https://github.com/emdashii/counterpoint_generator"
          class="link-dark text-decoration-none">github</a>, as they were being hosted somewhere else, so at least I'll
        have a
        copy of the code.
