            <h4>Project Overview:</h4>
            <p>
              ServiceNow is a behemoth platform. They provide templates to
              create enterprise apps, mostly for detailing organizations.
              AppVizo was contracted to build a networking app. This app tracks
              and details people, events, equipment, and connections between
              everything. It provides a detailed picture of the organization, so
              if something goes wrong, a user can find the problem and fix it
              easily. It tracks the status of networking equipment, and the
              connections between different pieces of equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of building this application on the ServiceNow platform,
              we put in dummy data, so that the client can see what it would
              look like if they were using the application. This dummy data
              included multiple sites, each of which consisted of buildings,
              which contain rooms (specifically server rooms), which contain
              racks, which contain networking equipment. Every server and router
              communicates with at least one piece of the network. Each is
              powered redundantly. All this is modeled in the ServiceNow app.

            <h4>What I did:</h4>
            <p>
              A lot of what I did involved entering data. ServiceNow provides a
              couple of ways to enter data. One is to format an excel document
              to be precisely the way they will recognize it, and then upload
              it. This way, unfortunately, does not allow for any connections
              between different pieces of data. So instead, ServiceNow has an
              Xplore page, where you can write JavaScript (in ES5) that can
              access and update tables in their database. With this method, you
              can call up two different tables, and find specific items in each
              to reference in a third table.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, say you have a router and a server that are linked.
              You could search the router table, the server table, and then link
              them in the CMDB, which is a specific third table. In the linking,
              you can specify which port and IP address each uses. That way, if
              something goes wrong with the server, you can easily look up where
              it gets its data, and find fixes easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Javascript, I have probably made over five thousand
              records/changes to records in AppVizo's ServiceNow developer
              instance. Some of these were creating records from scratch and
              generating random data. Some of these, the data was already
              generated, and I had to enter it in a way where every record
              connected to the correct thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>tl;dr</b> I wrote lots of JavaScript to update ServiceNow's
              database.
