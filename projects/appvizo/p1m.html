          <h4>Project Overview:</h4>
          <p>AppVizo had previously written a webscraper for this client. It scraped a website, edited the returned
            data, and then outputted a csv file. This ran daily on a server. The client added functionality, scraping
            multiple other websites. This added complexity, until it was difficult to tell what part of the program did
            what. There were multiple files hundreds of lines of code long. Some of them were redundant, but it was
            unclear what was actually used and important.</p>
          <p>The client came back to AppVizo and asked for additional functionality, scraping another website, as well
            as combining all the different scrapes into a single file. (Each one was outputting a separate csv file.)
          </p>
          <h4>What I did:</h4>
          <p>I read through all the current code and figured out what each piece did, and which pieces were copies of
            functions from other files. I added a
          <pre>def main()</pre> and<br><br>
          <pre>if __name__ == "__main__": 
    main()</pre> to each file, and then called the relevant ones from a main.py
          file. This added clarity to what ran when.</p>
          <p>One of the other programmers added SQLite to the program. After that was done, I added that functionality
            to all the other files, so that everything outputted to a SQLite file, which at the end put out a single csv
            file. This helped the code to run faster, and made it easier to debug if any of the web scrapes failed. It
            also helped to format each scrape into a similar data format, which the client needed.</p>
          <p><b>tl;dr</b> Refactored a client's python code and added additional functionality using pandas and SQLite.
          </p>
