      <h2 class="mt-5">What is a split keyboard?</h2>
      <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../../images/crkbd.jpg" alt="My corne Keyboard">
      <p>This is a split keyboard. In fact, this is my split keyboard. It is a crkbd corne, which I have programmed a
        custom keymap for.</p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Why would anyone want a split keyboard?</h2>
      <p>A split keyboard is a significant improvement in ergonomics. Most keyboards have people's arms twisted in and
        their fingers at awkward angles. This position also scrunches people's shoulders together. When the halves of
        the keyboard are moved apart, your shoulders open up. Also, in the ergonomics department, you can “tent” the
        keyboard. When people's hands are palms down in front of them, it puts extra pressure on the forearms. Once you
        tent the keyboard, which is to raise the edge in the center, it puts your hands into a more neutral position.
        Some people tent their keyboards so the halves are almost ninety degrees, while others do more like fifteen
        through thirty degrees.</p>
      <p> The keys on this keyboard are ortholinear, which means they go in vertical rows. This means that each finger
        has to travel less distance and the finger movement is more natural. Also, because there are fewer keys, a
        finger only ever has to reach a key that is one key away from the home row. If your hands never leave the home
        row, then you can have a very accurate mental map of where all the keys are. Part of the design philosophy
        behind a keyboard with less keys is that when you have less keys, you don't need to stretch your fingers to get
        to any key. This is something I didn't notice much until I started programming more heavily and was typing
        ctrl+shift+arrow keys, parentheses, and function keys a lot. Each time I had to type a complicated chord
        (combination of keys) or move my hands away from the home row, it would take a bit to reset. Using a split
        keyboard completely eliminates this. Through keyboard shortcuts, I can type, edit text, and swap programs
        without having to take my hands off the keyboard. I'll include a non-exhaustive list of useful keyboard
        shortcuts at the bottom of this page. The split keyboard isn't quite like a full fledged vim editor, but it's
        close. And, when I'm typing and editing, my hands almost never move. It really feels like magic.</p>
      <p>Split keyboards are fun! You can design your own keymap and layout, and program the LEDs and screens to do
        exactly what you want. This allows a ton of creativity and people have come up with clever keymaps.</p>
      <p>Split keyboards allow you to use your thumb more effectively. An opposable thumb is a genius of engineering,
        and for input we only use it to hit the spacebar. Split keyboards often give multiple keys to the thumb, so that
        another digit can be used effectively. This is something that I can't believe I've never thought of before. Why
        have my thumbs been so underutilized on all keyboards before this?</p>
      <p>Finally, split keyboards are more portable than full sized keyboards. This is great when some days I work from
        home and some days I go into the office. I can easily transport my keyboard between places.</p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">How can you type/program with so few keys?</h2>
      <p>Aha, this is really the crux of the question. This keyboard uses layers to easily access every key. In fact, I
        would argue that it's easier to type any key than on a 100% keyboard. (Mine is a 40% keyboard.) Everyone already
        uses at least one layer on any keyboard, the shift layer. A key will output a lowercase letter, unless shift is
        held down or capslock is on. This functionally doubles the number of characters a keyboard can output. Not
        counting shift as a layer, this keyboard has three layers. The first contains all the letters. The second
        contains all symbols and numbers. The third contains all navigation keys and function keys. With a keyboard like
        this, you can program as many layers as you want. Here is a map of my keyboard layers.</p>
      <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../../images/keymap.jpg" alt="My keymap">
      <p>After only a few weeks, I have almost every key memorized on each layer. This is way better than on the
        standard keyboard, where I always have had to look down to know what symbol I want to type.</p>
      <p>This keymap has a few things that I think are really cool. The first is called <a
          href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods" class="link-dark text-decoration-none">Home Row Mods</a>.
        This allows me to
        press the windows key, alt, shift, and control using the keys on the homerow, rather than having to move my
        fingers to any keys. If I need to shift a key on my left hand, I press shift with my right middle finger. If I
        need to press shift with my right hand, I hold down my left ring finger. This is amazing. If you want to know
        more, click the link above.</p>
      <p>The second cool thing is that I have a numpad for my right hand. Typing numbers on a numpad is more intuitive,
        though I recognize that basically everyone has gotten used to the number row. I hold down one key with my left
        thumb, and I'm in my symbols layer. Then I can type all the numbers I want, and when I release that key, I'm
        back to typing letters.</p>
      <p>The other keyboard feature that I like a lot is having arrow keys right where my left hand naturally rests. I
        have gotten used to using WASD playing many games, but when I was making the keymap, I realized that while
        typing, my hand naturally rests on ESDF, which I still think of as WASD, just shifted over one key. This way,
        when I'm in my navigation layer, I don't have to move my left hand over a key to get to the arrow keys.</p>
      <p>If you're still with me, one of the final cool keyboard layer features I designed was how to move between the
        layers. Most split keyboards come with a layer shifting feature that works like a shift button. While that key
        is held down, you are in the layer. This is very intuitive and useful, but after watching <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BenVallack" class="link-dark text-decoration-none">Ben Vallack's YouTube
          channel</a>, I saw that he was trying to avoid “chording”, which is where you press multiple keys at once. So
        I made
        a second way to access the layers. The first way is to hold down space. Space on the left side takes you to the
        symbols and numbers layer. Space on the right side takes you to the arrow keys and function keys layer. The
        second way is to tap the button next to space. When you tap it, it will take you to the layer for one keypress.
        This is useful, for example, when you want to hit a function key at a specific time. You can tap the button next
        to space and know that your keyboard will interpret the next keypress as that layer. But now, what if you want
        to stay in that layer? If you tap the button a second time, it'll keep you in the layer. A third key has been
        programmed to always take you to the alphabet layer, no matter what layer you are on, and when you are on the
        alphabet layer, it does nothing. This way, if I need to do a lot of arrow key movements, I can double tap my
        layer switch key, do the movements, and if I want to go home, I can tap the alphabet layer key. I think that
        this system is pretty intuitive, and better than if the key took you to the layer and the same key took you back
        home. There is minimal visual feedback with this keyboard, and you often want to be very sure you know what keys
        you are pressing. If you followed all of that, good for you! This system is not perfect, and I'm still thinking
        of ways to improve it, but I've been using it for the past few weeks and enjoy it. I hadn't seen any keyboard
        layouts that did something similar online, and I researched multiple before starting to make my own. My keyboard
        files are available on my <a
          href="https://github.com/emdashii/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/emdashiiAnimation"
          class="link-dark text-decoration-none">github</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">How do you get a split keyboard?</h2>
      <p>There are many options. If you already have mechanical key switches and caps, the cheapest is probably to build
        your own. This would cost around $30 (if you have a 3D printer) to $80 (if you don't). If you just want to
        assemble the parts and not do any soldering, expect to pay around $200. You can also sometimes find split
        keyboards on esty or ebay around that price. For a fully assembled professionally made one, expect to pay
        anywhere from $250-up. The <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/" class="link-dark text-decoration-none">ZSA
          Moonlander</a> is well regarded and has very customizable software. If you want one
        that is sculpted to your hand, look for the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/"
          class="link-dark text-decoration-none">Kinesis Advantage2</a> or a <a
          href="https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard" class="link-dark text-decoration-none">Dactyl Manuform</a>.
        These get more pricey. If
        you want fewer keys, look for a <a href="https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep"
          class="link-dark text-decoration-none">Ferris Sweep</a> or <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd"
          class="link-dark text-decoration-none">crkbd Corne</a>, like I have. There are almost infinite variations
        of split keyboards that people have come up with. Some have tenting built in, and others don't. Some have <a
          href="https://github.com/greyhatmiddleman/crkbd-pimoroni-trackball"
          class="link-dark text-decoration-none">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis"
          class="link-dark text-decoration-none">trackball</a> or a <a
          href="https://github.com/joric/jorne/wiki/Trackpoint" class="link-dark text-decoration-none">trackpoint</a>
        built into the keyboard. I'd like to build one of those and see how I like it, because
        it would mean that I would have to reach for the mouse less than I already do.</p>
